# Scrapyard Cary

Welcome to the official repo for **Scrapyard Cary**, part of Hack Club’s worldwide Winter 2025 hackathon.

I organized and led this free, 24-hour in-person hackathon in Cary, NC, bringing together high school students from across the state to build and ship projects. We raised over $2500 in funding, had 40+ participants, and hit a 80 %+ project deployment success rate.

This event was part of Hack Club, the world’s largest open-source community for teen builders.

Right now, I’m working on building a system to make Scrapyard Cary happen **twice a year**, with long-term community partners. I’m currently in talks with a local 3D printer store and Cary Parks & Rec to secure ongoing venue access and support.
